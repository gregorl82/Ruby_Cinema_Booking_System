<h1>SQL Cinema Booking System</h1>

<p>Create a system that handles bookings for a newly built cinema.</p>

<h2>The app should have:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
  Customers
  <ul>
    <li>name</li>
    <li>funds</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>
  Films
  <ul>
    <li>title</li>
    <li>price</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>
  Tickets
  <ul>
    <li>customer_id</li>
    <li>film_id</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The app should be able to:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create customers, films and tickets.</li>
<li>CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete) customers, films and tickets.</li>
<li>Show which films a customer has booked to see, and see which customers are coming to see one film.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Basic extensions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Buying tickets should decrease the funds of the customer by the price</li>
<li>Check how many tickets were bought by a customer</li>
<li>Check how many customers are going to watch a certain film</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advanced extensions:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a screenings table that lets us know what time films are showing</li>
<li>Write a method that finds out what is the most popular time (most tickets sold) for a given film</li>
<li>Limit the available tickets for screenings.</li>
</ul>
